AI, these last couple of years have really been ramping up. These days we have AI like Chatgpt or Bing AI that can be used to solve a problem or create a picture in the fraction of the time a human can do it in. There are many benefits for the development of AI such as Humans no longer needing to do dangerous jobs but there are also negatives that come with the development of AI such as some professions being taken over by AI and a lot of people losing their jobs to AI.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3">Some Positive Impacts that come from the development of Artificial Intelligence are things like the fact that AI is now automating factory lines and other jobs that are not really that important so now humans can spend that extra manpower on other fields that need extra manpower. Another benefit is Artificial Intelligence is more precise than humans and so Artificial Intelligence minimizes error to max compared to a human who might make many errors if they are doing the same job as the AI. One last benefit that is shown from the Development of AI is that AI can help with Medical professions by helping Identify diseases fast and prescribing the medicine that will have a better effect on the illness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3">While there are many Positives that come with the Development in the Field of Artificial Intelligence, There are also some negatives to the development of Ai. One example of the negative effect of using AI instead of Manpower is that Artificial Intelligence lacks the Creativity that humans have and it doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to think outside of the box to solve the problems and only tries to solve the problem using the data it has collected. Another negative that comes with using AI instead of humans is that AI has no ethics or sense of right or wrong and will do whatever it needs to do in order to complete its goal and so there might be some blood spilled if people come in the way of the AI goal. One last Negative negative with using AI instead of humans is that when AI does all the work humans start to become lazy such as in the humans in the pixar movie Wally where everyone is fat a too lazy to do anything and rely on the AI to do all the work for them and they have completely forgotten how to do different jobs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3">My opinion about the development of Artificial intelligence is that while we should develop Artificial intelligence we should also not become too reliant on AI as that could become our downfall. I think that we should definitely keep developing AI as this would allow humans to free up more manpower for the most important industries such as the medicine industry or the education industry and help the country as well as the world improve towards a better place. But while do say that I still do feel like we should no become too dependent on AI to do our jobs as that will cause us to slow down our technological advancements in the future as we will be reliant on Artificial Intelligence to to all work as we just sit back and watch as while the knowledge that humans being that gathering over millions of years just stopping being used by humans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c3">All in all AI is a powerful power that can be an amazing help for the world and all the people who live on earth but it can also cause the development of mankind to slow down to the speed of a snail crawl as we do not try to develop anymore. We should always have some Industries that are human dominated as they are something that AI can never do. This will allow humans to not become too overly reliant on the power of AI to do everything and humans can still be self-sufficient. This is important because if we ever lose the source of AI power which is fossil fuels or electricity and we are not self-sufficient, humans will start to suffer in the disappearance of AI.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c6 c13"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Annotated Bibliography</span></p><p class="c10 c5"><span class="c8">Duggal, N.
